# School District Analysis

## Overview
The data worked on in this analysis consisted of data relating to high schools. 
This data included the english and reading scores of students throughout multiple high schools.
It was discovered that in the 9th grade classes of "Thomas High School", there was an instance of academic dishonesty that altered the data.
Maria reached out to have the 9th grade data from this school removed without disrupting any of the other data.
After this data is removed the new completed data was reanalyzed to discover how the removal of this grade level affected the overall data.

## Results
